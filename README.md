# Claude GitHub Triage

An AI-powered GitHub issue triage bot that uses Claude Code SDK to analyze issues in the context of your codebase and provide intelligent recommendations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Claude to analyze issues with full codebase context
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests whether to close issues, what labels to add, and provides response templates
- **Batch Processing**: Process single issues or multiple issues with pagination support
- **Review System**: Track which triaged issues you've reviewed with an inbox-style interface
- **Concurrency Control**: Process multiple issues in parallel with configurable limits
- **Skip Detection**: Automatically skips already-triaged issues (with force option)
- **GitHub Sync**: Mark closed issues as read automatically

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

2. Set up your GitHub token:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
```

## Review Workflow

### Classic Workflow

A typical workflow for triaging and reviewing issues:

1. **Initial Triage**: Run triage on your repository
   ```bash
   bun cli.ts triage -o owner -r repo -p ./codebase
   ```

2. **Check Inbox**: See what needs review
   ```bash
   bun cli.ts inbox --filter unread
   ```

3. **Review Issues**: Go through unread issues
   ```bash
   bun cli.ts review --all  # Review all
   # or
   bun cli.ts review       # Review one at a time
   ```

4. **Sync Periodically**: Keep inbox clean
   ```bash
   bun cli.ts sync -o owner -r repo
   ```

### Interactive TUI Workflow ðŸŽ‰ NEW!

For a faster, more visual experience:

1. **Initial Triage**: Same as above
   ```bash
   bun cli.ts triage -o owner -r repo -p ./codebase
   ```

2. **Launch Interactive Inbox**: Browse issues visually
   ```bash
   bun cli.ts inbox --interactive
   ```

3. **Navigate and Review**:
   - Scrollable table shows all issues with key metadata
   - Use `â†‘/â†“` to browse through the table
   - **Quick filters**:
     - Press `2` for unread, `3` for read, `4` for done, `5` for unread+not-done
     - Press `C` to show only "should close" issues
     - Press `K` to show only "should keep" issues
     - Press `/` to search by text
     - Press `ESC` to clear all filters
   - Press `Enter` to open full triage in your editor
   - Press `W` to open issue on GitHub in your browser
   - Press `R` to manually mark as read
   - Press `D` to mark as done (e.g., after fixing)

4. **Configure Settings** (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   # Set the GitHub repo (required for title fetching and web links)
   bun cli.ts config set-repo owner/repo
   
   # Set your preferred default editor
   bun cli.ts config set-editor zed  # or vim, cursor, code, nvim
   
   # View all settings
   bun cli.ts config show
   ```

5. **Quick Open**: Open specific issues directly
   ```bash
   bun cli.ts open 123  # Opens in default editor
   ```

## How It Works

### Triage Process

1. The bot fetches issues from your GitHub repository
2. For each issue, it uses Claude Code SDK to:
   - Explore your codebase to understand the context
   - Search for relevant code, documentation, and implementations
   - Analyze whether the issue is valid, a duplicate, or needs attention
3. It creates markdown files in the `results/` directory with detailed analysis
4. Tracks metadata in `results/.triage-metadata.json` for review status

### File Structure

```
results/
â”œâ”€â”€ issue-123-triage.md          # Triage analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ issue-123-triage-debug.json  # Debug info (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ issue-124-triage.md
â””â”€â”€ .triage-metadata.json        # Review tracking metadata
```

### Triage Output Format

Each triage file contains:

```
=== TRIAGE ANALYSIS START ===
SHOULD_CLOSE: Yes/No
LABELS: label1, label2, label3
CONFIDENCE: High/Medium/Low

ANALYSIS:
[Detailed analysis and reasoning]

SUGGESTED_RESPONSE:
[Optional response template for the issue]
=== TRIAGE ANALYSIS END ===
```

## API Usage

You can also use the library programmatically:

```typescript
import { IssueTriage } from 'claude-github-triage';

const triager = new IssueTriage(githubToken);

const recommendation = await triager.triageIssue(
  'owner',
  'repo',
  123,
  '/path/to/codebase'
);

console.log(recommendation);
```

## Output Format

All triage results are saved as markdown files in the `results/` directory. Example file structure:

```markdown
# Issue #123: Feature Request: Add dark mode

## Recommendation
Should Close: No

## Suggested Labels
- enhancement
- UI/UX

## Confidence Level
High

## Analysis
This is a valid feature request that aligns with modern application standards...

## Suggested Response
Thank you for your suggestion! Dark mode is indeed a valuable feature...
```

## Requirements

- Bun runtime (v1.0+)
- GitHub personal access token with repo permissions
- Access to Claude Code SDK
- A local codebase to analyze issues against

## Environment Variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token (required for API access)

## Tips

- **Concurrency**: Adjust `--concurrency` based on your rate limits and system resources
- **Pagination**: When triaging without `--limit`, the tool fetches ALL issues page by page
- **Skip Detection**: Already-triaged issues are automatically skipped unless you use `--force`
- **Review Workflow**: Use `inbox` â†’ `review` â†’ `sync` for an efficient workflow
- **Debug Info**: Check `issue-*-debug.json` files for Claude's full analysis process
